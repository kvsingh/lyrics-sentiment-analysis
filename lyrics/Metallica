[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Guitar Solo: James Hetfield]

[Verse 3: James Hetfield]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah

[Guitar Solo: James Hetfield]

[Outro: James Hetfield]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters



[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in
Warm within
Keep you free from sin
Until the sandman he comes

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

My friends, put you hands like this man

[Spoken Interlude: James Hetfield & Bob Rock's Son]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
And
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Pray the lord my soul to take
My friends, put you hands like this man

[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Hush little baby don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet in your head

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

Come on people
Hey yeah, oh oh yeah

[Outro: James Hetfield]
We're off to never never-land

Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to revealing
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Bridge]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

[Instrumental Outro]



[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
New blood joins this Earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away easy

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Whoa

[Outro: James Hetfield]
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"



[Verse 1]
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Verse 2]
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!



[Verse 1]
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

[Verse 2]
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

[Verse 3]
Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right
Yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill
Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Give it to me
You bet you
For whom the bell tolls

[Outro]



[Verse 1]
Life, it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

[Verse 3]
No one but me can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try

[Outro]
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye...



[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Chorus 1]
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Chorus 2]
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

[Chorus 3]
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Chorus 1]
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Chorus 2]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master
Master

[Chorus 3]
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
(Master, master, master, master)

[Bridge]
Master, Master, where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master, Master, you promised only lies
Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries

FIX ME!!!!

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

[Chorus 2]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master
Master

[Chorus 3]
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Ha ha ha ha
(ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)



Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

[Bridge]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away

[Chorus]
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Burn!

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won’t do that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Addicted to the
Fame
