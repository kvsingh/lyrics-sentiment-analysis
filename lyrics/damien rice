[Verse: Lisa Hannigan]
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lisa Hannigan]
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I got no excuse

[Refrain: Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That all right, yeah?
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
That all right, yeah?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That all right, yeah, with you?

[Verse: Damien Rice]
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Damien Rice]
It's the wrong time
She's pulling me through
It's a small crime
And I got no excuse

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
To give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right?
That all right with you?

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
That all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right?
Is that all right with you?

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
(To give my gun away when it's loaded)
Is that all right, yeah?
(You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?)
Is that all right, yeah?
(To give my gun away when it's loaded)
Is that all right? Is that all right?
Is that all right with you? No



[Verse 1: Damien Rice]
And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time

[Verse 2: Damien Rice]
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her skies

[Chorus: Damien Rice]
I can't take my eyes off of you (x6)

[Verse 3: Damien Rice]
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time

[Verse 4: Damien Rice]
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

[Chorus: Damien Rice]
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you

[Bridge: Lisa Hannigan]
Oh, did I say
That I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

[Chorus & Outro: Damien Rice]
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
My mind
My mind...
Till I find somebody new



[Verse 1]
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?

[Verse 2]
We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?



[Verse 1]
It takes a lot to know a man
It takes a lot to understand
The warrior, the sage
The little boy in rage

It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to understand what's humming
The honey-bee, the stings
The little girl with wings

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

[Verse 2]
It takes a lot to know a man
A lot to know, to understand
The father and the son
The hunter and the gun

It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to comprehend what's coming
The mother and the child
The muse and the beguiled

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

It takes a lot to live
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

What are you so afraid to lose?
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're so afraid so to lose?
It takes a lot to know a man...
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
It takes a lot to know a man...
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you carry on your back?
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you notice when you can't laugh?
(Know you can, have to know)
(Killing me)



[Verse 1: Damien Rice]
Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

[Verse 2: Lisa Hannigan]
Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth, your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

[Bridge: Damien Rice]
What I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new, no no
Just another phase of finding
What I really need
Is what makes me bleed
But like a new disease
Lord, she's still too young to treat

What I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)

What I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
And what I am to you (oh she's still too young) i
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) y
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)

You do not need me



[Verse 1]
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to see what's going on
Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed

[Pre-Chorus]
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon

[Verse 3]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
So come on courage!
Teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know



[Produced by Rick Rubin]

You could be my favourite taste
To touch my tongue
I know someone who could serve me love
But it wouldn’t fill me up

You could have my favourite face
And favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldn’t be the same

No it wouldn’t be the same
No it wouldn’t be the same
No it wouldn’t be the same
As with you

You could be my favourite place
I’ve ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream

You could be my favourite faded fantasy
I’ve hung my happiness upon what it all could be

And what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you
What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you

You could hold the secrets that save
Me from myself
I could love you more than love could
All the way from hell

You could be my poison, my cross
My razor blade
I could love you more than life
If I wasn’t so afraid

Of what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
Of what it all what it all could be
With you
What it all what it all could be
Of what it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you

Love dissolved the bloom
Always watch it
Never let someone go or they
I ain't never loved like you

I’ve never loved I've never loved
I’ve never loved loved loved like you
I’ve never loved
I’ve never loved
I’ve never loved



I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes
Didn't I?

I helped you open out your wings
Your legs, and many other things
Didn't I?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
The only one who let you go?
The one you hurt so much you cannot bear?

Well we were good, when we were good
When we were not misunderstood

You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive
Didn't you?

I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame
Didn't you?

Am I the greatest bastard that you met?
The only one you can't forget?
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?

Or am I just dreaming once again?
Some dreams are better when they end

Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down

We learn to wag and tuck our tails
We learn to win and then to fail
Didn't we?

We learn that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling
Didn't we?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
When will we learn to let this go?
We fought so much, we've broken all the charm

But letting go is not the same
As pushing someone else away

So please don't let on
You don't know me
Please don't let on
I'm not here
Please don't let on
You don't love me
Cause I know you do
I know

That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant...



[Verse 1]
Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well, I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well, not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing

[Chorus]
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Verse 2]
Wherever you go
Well, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well, I'm more than willing

[Chorus - x2]
'Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
And I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Verse 3]
I've never been with anyone
In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed

[Bridge]
'Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall

[Chorus]
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind



Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers darlin'
I got years to wait around for you
Cheers darlin'
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
Cheers darlin'
You give me three cigarettes to smoke my tears away

And I die when you mention his name
And I lied, I should have kissed you
When we were running in the rain

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover man
Cheers darlin'
I just hang around and eat from a can
Cheers darlin'
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
Cheers darlin'
I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far from me

I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy
I should have kissed you when we were alone

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Oh what am I? What am I darlin'?
I got years to wait...
