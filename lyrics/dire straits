[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear that music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – He's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"



A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like, You and me babe, how about it?

Juliet says, Hey it's Romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack
He's underneath the window she's singing, Hey la my boyfriend's back
You shoudn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet when you exploded in my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say, Oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

I can't do the talk like they talking on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way its meant to be
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it
How about it

I shoulda learned to play the guitar

And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free

[Chorus: Knopfler and Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TV's

[Outro: Knopfler and Sting]

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be

Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged high
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die

But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms



[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 2]
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Outro]
And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, you do the walk of life



A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, and they never went back
Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road

You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again

From all of these signs saying, "sorry, but we're closed"
All the way
Down the telegraph road



[Verse 1]
Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

[Verse 2]
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rockaway rockaway

[Chorus 2]
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids

[Verse 3]
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down?
You're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
Cause you're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

[Verse 3]
And I get so tired when I have to explain
Then you're so far away from me
See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, take it down

...so far away...
You're so far away from me
Alright
I 'm so far away from you



[Verse 1]
Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectation left to come up to, yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah, she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

[Verse 2]
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You'd talk to me when you felt like it

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

[Bridge]
Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd a call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus your mother was a Jazz singer

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Oh, yeah
Another time, another place

[Verse 3]
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the
Lady writer on the TV (lady writer on the TV)

[Outro]
Talking about the Virgin Mary (lady writer)
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me (lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV (lady writer on the TV)
Talking about the Virgin Mary (lady writer)
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me (lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer



I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And I've called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And I'm fading away
Father please hear my confession

I have legalized robbery
Called it  belief
I have a-run with the money
I have a-hid like a thief
Re-written history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong

Well I've tried to be meek
And I've tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong

Well the sun rose on the courtyard
And they all did hear him say
"You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife"
Oh father please help me
For I have done wrong
The man's too big
The man's too strong
