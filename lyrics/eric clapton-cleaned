Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
Because I know I just can't stay here in heaven
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven
If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
See if you can spot this one?
What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody is waiting by your side?
You have been running and hiding much too long
You know it is just your foolish pride
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Let us make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don’t say we will never find a way
And tell me all my love in vain
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Thank you
It's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"
If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
And I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, I just did not care
Took all my friends out for a good time
Bought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm going to hang on to it until that eagle grins
Because no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any
When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will alway burn
I'll never get over
I know that I'll never learn
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then I'll be alright someday
I'll overcome
I'll overcome
I'll overcome someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then I'll overcome someday
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then I’ll be going home someday
Lord I’ll be going home someday
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mother said
"Son, do not call my daughter no more"
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else
Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
If I don't go on and quit you
I'm going to lose my mind
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else
There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave
Lay down, Sally and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
Sun isn't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me? Don't you ever leave
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave
