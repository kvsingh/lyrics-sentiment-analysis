Follow me underwater
Until the searchlights leave the shore
Follow me underwater
Until we find what we're looking for
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm
They found the pipeline through the soul in the soil
I thought this place never changed
But now the reefs are bleeding smells of oil
And the forests are up in flames
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
Give me a reason, tell me why we lost our reason
Tell me the truth, not an excuse
Cause we have everything to lose
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm
There's a cancer in our lifeblood, so silently it grew
The streams of least resistance poison me and poison you
There’s a virus in the air, that drags the wind out from my chest
I don’t see a way out
All I see is a sphere of unrest
Show me a way out
Show me a way out
Show me a way out
Follow me underwater
Until the searchlights leave the shore
Follow me underwater
Until we find what we're looking for
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
Time in constant motion
Like the shifting desert sands
Slipping through my hands
Chasing down the minutes
That turn into days
Seconds get shorter
As years fall away
Chasing down my dreams
Under borrowed light
A mirage in the distance
Escaping my sight
Driven to live or driven apart
What's inside us when we depart
Driven to live outside of regret
Time is finite, the clocks are set
Driven to live or driven apart
Driven to live or driven apart
I realize my flame is burning away
Starward searching I will find my way
The power of the mind ready to combust
I will show you fear in a handful of dust
I will show you fear in a handful of dust
Combust
My flame is fleeting
But I will live and learn
Rise and burn, Tick and Turn
Rise and burn
Time in constant motion
Like the shifting desert sands
Slipping through my hands
Driven to live or driven apart
What's inside us when we depart
Driven to live outside of regret
Time is finite, the clocks are set
Driven to live or driven apart
Driven to live or driven apart
Combust
Save us
If you thought you knew it all
Don’t shift your view, you might slip and fall
A long way down and down this rabbit hole
If the tunnel runs any deeper
You might come out the other side of the world
Maybe upside down you’ll be able see this isn’t what it seems
We are far from free
We’re caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper into the unknown
We’re caught in the undertow
Follow the leader down with the undertow
Action floats in limbo like driftwood in the sea
Under CCTV, so dig down deep
The more you uncover, the more you disbelieve
The more you will discover
We are far from free
Heroes exposing corruption in who we obey
Blow the whistle from a burning stake
The whistle blows from a burning stake
Corruption won’t keep revolution at bay
We’re caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper into the unknown
We’re caught in the undertow
Follow the leader down with the undertow
Spied on, lifelong, collection 24/7
Archives of all we’ve done
Satellites track our lives beyond the skies
Not even your mind can hide from big brother’s eyes
It’s time to take back our home
Thank you Mr. Snow
Waves of poverty, of hope and desperation
Waves of tragedy, of death and desolation
Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind can't you see you're fucking blind
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind
Stranger, so far from home
There's a terror in your eyes
You whisper words of a hell unknown
Stranger in a sea unclear
The currents that drifted us now draw us near
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Who's gonna save them?
Running from war to woe there's nowhere to go
Neighbour will you take my hand?
Is there still virtue in your heart
That will shelter me from dark?
Have you stopped to think and reflect that in this lifetime
Your child could be next?
All we show is neglect
Why do we disconnect the hearts
From the lives that fell apart?
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Who's gonna save them?
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
Mayhem
Mayhem
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
Save them
Save them
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
Borders built to barricade
No one enters, no one is saved
Borders built to barricade
Building walls
Digging graves
The rivers rise with the lives of dead men
Open up the gates
Welcome to mayhem
Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind
Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe there's nowhere to go
Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe there's nowhere to go
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know

Running from war to woe there's nowhere to go

The last of our martyrs seeks no adoration
From his castle in the air of eternal vibration
We won’t lose sight of the lasting words he wrote
We won’t lose sight of what matters most
A shining beacon of wisdom
Armed to the teeth
Fearless conviction
Now that he’s gone we’re going to miss him
Immortalised between the lines
Conceived by a human heart inside
He once said to us, my friend hope is a prison
But the hope his chords sung only spread love
In a hollow crowned kingdom
There are no fighters left here anymore
See you on the other side
Of that open door
We won't lose sight
We won't lose sight
Of the lasting words he wrote
We won’t lose sight of what matters most
In an age where stars only draw us in
Gaze is swept from our mother who birthed us here
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host
Silenced by the solar wind
Forests evergreen wither to sand
There’s still shade in this wasteland
Shadows of towering glass span
As far as you can set your sights on
Take a good long look at that horizon
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon
Open your eyes
Two worlds collide
Open your eyes
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host
Watch it die
I am what I create
Lashed by tongues of electric fire
Shimmering rivers crystalline
Run though frozen glimpses in time
And I just can't ignore this sight
Pouring down on me relentlessly
I just can't ignore this feeling
Deafened by rolling waves of realisation
Frozen, mesmerised in the rain
In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour
Droplets of life form in freefall in convalescence
They hammer into the soil
Carving new streams of essence, through turmoil
I am just as fluid, as immortal and lucid
As the Earth that morphs, in the violence of a thunderstorm
My life is what I make of my trials and mistakes
My life is what I make, I am what I create
I am what I create
I am what I create
I am what I create
In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour
Comatose in the arms of Morpheus
Drifting away to a place
Where there’s more than this
Blindfolded visionary, eyes lost in the black and bleak
Chasing footsteps in the dark, lost for where they’ll lead
Idols and stars shower light on the sublime
Blinding your mind’s eye
Bright as your dreams shine
Blinding your mind’s eye
Reclaim your life
Reclaim your life
From the iron grip of social design
Reclaim your life
Your cycle around the sun is eclipsing
Like most of us I was misled into a swarm of noise and distortion
Eroding my deepest thoughts before my inner voice had spoken
To remind me I’m gifted with the power to dream
To see what has never been seen
But I handed it over, consumed by culture
Cloaking the eyes of the visionary
Comatose in the arms of Morpheus
Drifting away to a place
Where there’s more than this
Hypnosis
I am the tear in the gravity
The universal truth is my reality
In a drifting space
Where the dark draws near
I am stronger than fear
Collapse under the horizon
The ruins of a thousand stars
Illuminate who we are:
No drive
No direction
Purify
My perception
Sail on
Through the rift between the sky and ocean
Sail on
Find the peace that keeps your world in motion
Stare into the face of the sun
It melts away a shell of wax
To show the world how fucked I've become:
No drive
No direction
Purify my perception
There's a desert in my head
But an oasis in my dreams
Where veins glow in leaves
And illuminate the breeze
I will drag my being
To the edge of the beginning
Never still, never idle
Sever me from the endless spiral
Sail on
Through the rift between the sky and ocean
Sail on
Find the peace that keeps your world in motion
Lost inside a drifting space
Where drifting days interlace
And everything I saw so clear
Dances then disappears
I need to be grounded
But the plates keep shifting
So I look for my place
Where this space stops drifting
He saw the life slip from her emerald eyes
Confusion, illusion had soaked up her mind
She clutched his hand, whispered her soul
"I never wanted to grow so old
Life’s agony, turn off the machine
Let me leave this world with dignity"
Just let me leave this world
Bed of nails under the guillotine
Wake me up when my heart stops beating
When my heart stops beating
Wipe those tears of grief away, young man
Let me leave this world
Let me leave this world in peace
Turn off the machine, turn off the machine
Let me leave this world in peace
Raise me from this bed of nails
And let the angels carry me away
Carry me
Carry me away
Bed of nails under the guillotine
Wake me up when my heart stops beating
When my heart stops beating
Let me leave this world
