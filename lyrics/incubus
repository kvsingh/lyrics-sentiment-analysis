[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm
Beginning to find I should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
But lately I'm
Beginning to find when I drive myself, my light is found

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Bridge]
Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there



[Verse 1]
We all have a weakness
But some of ours are easy to identify
Look me in the eye
And ask for forgiveness
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again
Yes, you are my friend
We all have something that digs at us
At least we dig each other
So when weakness turns my ego up
I know you'll count on the me from yesterday

[Chorus]
If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone

[Verse 2]
We all have a sickness
That cleverly attaches and multiplies
No matter how we try
We all have someone that digs at us
At least we dig each other
So when sickness turns my ego up
I know you'll act as a clever medicine

[Chorus]
If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone

[Outro]
Oh, each other
When everything
Else is gone



[Verse 1]
Has it come to this?
We're stuck in the weeds
I get it, I'm not perfect
I was never trying to be
But I'm not long for this earth
If we really only ever get one chance to burn
I gotta trip before I can see the finish
How else would I learn?
I wanna know, how is it you do it?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Verse 2]
I swing and I miss
And then come the creeps
It makes me want to faint
I wanna know, how is it you do it?
How do you spill the paint?
And then fit it into a frame?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Break]

[Bridge]
Has it come to this?
Has it come to this?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Look out
Won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Chorus]
You're a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars?



[Intro]
Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

[Verse 1]
A decade ago
I never thought I would be
At twenty-three
On the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe is me

But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Now two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, "I can relate!"
Because lately I've been thinking of combustication
As a welcomed vacation
From the burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Never be the same, yeah
Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Pardon me, never be the same, yeah



[Verse 1]
I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind
Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy - happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 3]
The world's a roller coaster
And I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here



[Verse 1]
It’s like an intuition, or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression that’s always everywhere
You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

[Verse 2]
It’s an open invitation, come see the sights of sages
We’ve been a pride of lions, so afraid to leave our cages
Don’t fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]X2

You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]X2



[Verse 1]
I feel like I may have been here before
All of it looks so familiar
I wanna see beyond the obvious
So show me a new constellation

[Chorus]
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[Verse 2]
I feel like I’m always the last to know
The king of the dunces and the idiots
But where is the bliss in all this ignorance?
Oh just show me a new constellation

[Chorus]
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

[Bridge]
Never again, never again, never again
Don’t you get it?
I only want to break your spell
Ohh oh ohhh
Don’t you get it?
You’re the snake that eats its tail

[Chorus]
Hey!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Hey!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

[Outro]
Ay!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
He he he why man?
Heheheh... aw



[Verse 1]
Could there be another universe?
One that wasn't always out to getcha?
Man, it breaks my heart a little bit
That you're like a sleepwalker
Half alive and hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet, no
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a poem in reverse
Spoken and it holds me out forever
Man, it breaks my heart a little bit, oh
That love is like a blind archer
Tryin' to shoot an apple off my head

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet
Not yet

[Bridge]
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
Not dead yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm bent but not broken (ooh)
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)
No



[Intro]
You are stellar

[Verse 1]
Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
Won't you come with me?
We could start again

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

[Verse 2]
Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place
It might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

[Bridge]
You are stellar

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do



It's only a trust fall
It's only a trust fall

[Verse 1]
Things have been a little inside out, apologies
Babe, I'm gonna ride out the tide, take it in stride
Where would I run to?
Even if I was in disguise, it'll follow me
It's funny how the little things stick, make you seasick
Sweep you off your feet!
Sweep me off my feet!

[Chorus]
It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe

[Verse 2]
I like it when you look at me like I'm an alien
Lure me with a lock of your hair
Taking that dare is a fire under my feet
Now I see I gotta let go if I wanna know
Gotta let it steal my face
Now I embrace
What's in front of me!
Right in front of me!

[Chorus]
It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse
Lets you sail across the known universe

Everyone's in on it
And only a fool would quit
Love is the last and first!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Love is the last and first
Lets you sail across the known universe
It's only a trust fall
(aaaaaah)

It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Everyone's in on it
And only a fool would quit
Love is the last and first!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe

It's only a trust fall
(aaaaaah)

[Verse 3]
The palms of your feet
The whites of your eyes
The marrow in the tree
The sap in your bones
Same as the pistol, heavy in hand
Same as the storms, spinning on Io
Not a divide
That's an illusion, a collective dream
You startle and wake
Salute the abyss
Smile and surrender
Into a glimpse
The rapturous nothing
Into the arms of your captor
Into the arms of the all
Into the arms of the all
Into the arms  (of the all)
Of he all
