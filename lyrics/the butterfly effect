The butterfly effect, we keep 'em all in check

[Verse 1: Skits Vicious]
Rub a dub dub, two girls, one cup
Smothered in cum, two balls one cock
Gobble it up sluts (yes!), don't waiste none
Bukake, there's more where that came from
Ain't no justice, just sluts
Asses to asses, butts to butts
Your body's the canvas, my dick's the brush
I paint the picture of no love but lust
She's looking at me like, he must be nuts!
I'm looking at her like... You must eat nuts!

The butterflies in her stomach... Make her vomit...
Nah! She just needs drugs!
I got the butterfly effect on her
The reason she calls up a friend of her's
Bad bitches know, so they spread the word
There's a new sheriff in town, let's flirt!
From flirting comes kisses
From kisses comes fingers
From fingers comes something real' big that I insert
Pow! That hits the spot!
Bitches just keep coming back, that's cause I got:

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dopey Rotten]
Yeah I'm making her mad, she wants me so bad
She always says that I'm the best she ever had
I stick it deep down her throat, until she gags
Cumshot to the face, then she laughs
On to the next one, the next piece of ass
She dirty in the bedroom, acting high class
I'm down for the get down, I never just pass

She's butt naked, raising her glass
Toast to the scumbag that came to fast (Woops!)
Second time around, yeah you know I'll last
Beat her up good, made her come with a splash
Grabbed my clothes fast as I left in a dash
She felt like a whore so I left her some cash
Bumped into her girlfriend who wants to get smashed
Keeps on saying that she likes white trash
Here we go again, the effect still lasts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Reaper]
(Check, check) Check this, I'm a mess and sexist
Restless with them breasts, I'm wreckless
Test this, I want to impress the best bitch
Sex all my exes, come witness the wetness
I'm working my magic like a wizard
Kiss her, say:
Abracadabra, make that motherfucking bitch squirt
Straight in my face, I'm-a taste it, gracious!
I love to take a sip when I'm wasted, praise it!
All jokes aside, I'm mostly high
Don't divide, I'll have some American and Kosher Pie
I don't know why, but I want a ho in every areacode
And slide my pole inside

The coldest guy... No, I'll be a sweet dude
Candy for them sweetooth bitches
Brazilian to hebrew
I see through
Because my dick's already getting hard and
From the start, you knew I'd rip your clit apart
So pick a card, good bitches or bad bitches
Rags or riches, ask niggas want ass pictures
I get up in that ass vicious, passing the path Mrs
Butt stuff, I'm in the ass business
Christmas bitches, unwrapping the package
I fucked so savage my dick got casted
I guess I did it for the sex, I guess
Now them bitches keep me in check and that's:

[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 1:]
I see an old lady holding the door
As I tumble out my wheel chair and roll to the floor
First thing in the morning in the grocery store
Not sure if this alcoholics body can hold me no more
I hustled up enough change for the whiskey in my hand
Tried to tell all the people but they didn't understand
Too many years spent sleeping in the gutters
On my hands and on my knees, eating from the rubbish
Roam the streets with very little keeping me sane
Too many twisted visions left engraved deep in my brain
Nightmares are right there and I don't think good thoughts
Happy memories became haze and days when I could walk
Make me hate those that have a life and could stand
Do you people know what I sacrificed for this land?
My aching heart can't feel the bladed glass in my feet
Don't take a glance cause I'm just a face you pass in the street

[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 2:]
Evicted from my home couldn't scrape up the right rent
No heat in there all I had was the lights left
Spent months eating sleeping shitting in my mess
Thinking back to when my wife left, I was quite stressed
Guess all my addictions had got the best of me
Sometimes I wish to change my fate or was it destiny
Look up to the sky on rough nights wondering why
I saw our baby girl pass in front of my eyes
Before it the thought of it tortured me
Only lived six days was born with deformities
Still the birth really filled me with joy
Even though I kinda hoped it would still be a boy
I was dealing with demons I carried with me daily
Wanted to carry on my name when I had the little baby
Thinking in deep ways til my soul is torn
Of the bitter sweet day I came home from war

[Hook: Adrian]
If you could go back, what would you change
What would you do again ever would remain the same
What would you give, and what would you keep
What would you take, and what would you leave

[Verse 3:]
I roll out the hospital on honorable discharge
I looked down saw my body with horrible big scars
Brave face but it was bad at night I would break down
I woke up and I was paralyzed from the waist down
Was in a coma for a few weeks before I closed my eyes
I was just another soldier with two feet
On all type of drugs that set me higher
Shot by my comrade official name friendly fire
Everyone was screaming but I only heard her
And everyone was crying but I only heard her
As I looked down to what I had done
I had a split second to contemplate what I had become
Like it or not trained to kill like it was a job
Wild or not she was just a child with a rock
Threat in my eye and the power in my left hand
I swear my finger slipped and then the trigger went bang...



Charles Hamilton
Yeah...

[Verse I]
However this starts is the way that it should start
Everything I say is from the heart
Laid in an apartment next to
Some woman who swears she doesn't need a check to respect dudes
Guess who, is she real or a metaphor?
It doesn't matter, cause to be real I'm forever bored
Alone is the word that best describes
Nothing in common, I heard you testify
Sayin' you know how I feel...No one does
Maybe I feel this way cause I ain't grow enough
Showin' love to hoes and thugs who don't know me much
Status in a rich mans apparatus
Leaves them to being my friend for their satisfaction
And me writing songs in an unhappy fashion
Tucked away to die another day
My bond with myself keeps me promising help
But...

[Hook]
No one cares how you feel when you live in a cacoon
Nothing ever seems real when you live in a cacoon
Cacoon
Cacoon

[Verse II]
Yo Charles, I know you got connects
Gimme an A&R's number, say yeah Charles, Make me a star
I wonder, if I didn't chill with big wigs and get a deal
Would any of these niggas feel chills when I spit the real?
A frequent question of the successful but
I don't give a fuck about success so much
You wifin' the bitch but we sex so much her bed was just my nest for nuts
But me being me I couldn't accept that it was lust
Yes it was, a mess because she didn't accept my love
Like everyone else I encountered my whole life
"Charles rap? You wild'n" now it's "Wow, he so nice!
His style is so like-" Ugh, fuck up
I grew up a fucking fuck up
I drown in waves I'm too curly for a touch up
So what up?
That's why my wrist is all cut up...

[Hook]

[Verse III]
Yo
I don't wanna feel alone anymore
No more 3am searchin' through my phone anymore
My mom keeps callin' I love her, but listen
Mom, you trippin', just for gettin' my attention
Remember rippin' all the rhymes I had written?
Instrumental CD breakin cause I was dippin'
In and out class to write what's on my mind
At the time
Which helped me not cause a Columbine
Bottom line I feel betrayed by life
So scarred I feel like I gave Blade a knife
I'm the fuckin' vampire that gave Blade a bite
Supernatural can walk through the day at night
I just wanna be loved by someone
But we all want some
One

Charles Hamilton



[Verse: Tiger Fang]

(Starting to worry about)
Reaching times when my pockets go dry
And I can't find a dime to buy some lye that I can go and grind
Can't find, (who?), myself, that's who
See I've been lost up in the haze in my brain since June
2011, I swear I was in heaven for my teen years
Hit 20 years, and found out that I got so many fears
Terrified to fail or disapoint myself
I'm scared of not being able to pay for pop's bad health
Scared that I may melt, in a flame called hell
Cause I've been out of touch with God since 9 dash 12
9th Grade fights with white kids who called mom a terrorist
Now I'm rolling with the crooked kids who be the scariest
At Maple Hill Park, you'd see us when it's dark
We'd toke in the moonlight until those cop cars parked
They told me life don't get better if you blaze
I agree, but I still stayed the same, I don't change, God damn

Fuck it, ain't no way that I'mma love it
As I grow up I can feel them all just flying in my stomach
Mistakes, please help me to correct
Small steps, Witness, the Butterfly Effect

(Bitches ask)
Is he sad or is he sad for attention?
These fucking questions that all these hating bitches mention
I'm out the box, bitch you in, you got a life sentence
Write sentences on my mind's paper to kill tension
I mentioned my past. Those dreams that I had
If you don't dig em then ya'll say that my last album was whack
And they see that I ain't black, so they ask why do I rap
I respond and hit 'em back, and tell 'em that "well matter fact,"
See I don't really give a fuck, and I don't really give a damn
Enemies be acting tough and don't know who the fuck I am
I am me, I am me, and I swear I'll never be
Somebody with a brain different than what I got in my vicinity
You into me or not? Cause I swear you people stocked
With emotion, to the brim, past the point, that top you off
(With emotion, to the brim, past the point, that top you off.)

[Verse 1: Chavis Chandler]

Imagination is thinning and reality setting in
Welcome to life, where the fuck you been?
No more games, no console, no memory cards
No more saves, its on you. Your choices can make shit change
I was once the baller and the lame. The sucker nigga who
Joined a gang. Then I became the preacher who spoke
Everything in Jesus name but he was also addicted to the 'cain
I've seen life from many different views. I was the dude
Who made gargantuan moves, but thoughts was minuscule
And died of a bloody horrible death, took my last breath
Cause all of my fucking debts was past due, uh
The crazy shit I see with my eyes shut
When I was younger, man I couldn't make my mind up
Tryna choose between being the police of a fireman
Damn, I wish I knew everything I know in the present then

[Hook]

I feel like I done been here before
But what happened here last time
I don't want to happen no more
How long will it take, take, take
For me to realize (realize)
Its all in my mind
Tryna shake these butterflies
It's giving that effect

[Verse 2: Chavis Chandler]

There they go with that hating shit
I was once Hitler, they cower with my dictatorship
I was the scientist who was murdered for
Coming up with the cure for Aids
When the first person had it
They ain't let me save the bitch
To my squad I'm like the leg they hold the table with
The very reason why the axis spins
I'm that nigga that build the Pyramids
The government passed bills to poison the water
To make my third eye disappear
When I was born, the best thing to happen yet
I feel sorry for people who didn't catch it yet
I'm like a egg hatching from the fucking phoenix nest
That means I was born fire, watch me engulf this bitch
FLAME
Wreaking havoc on the fucking Mavericks
Now its fuck it, living lavish, staring through designer glasses
Its way deeper than rap shit, niggas not in my bracket
Its a whole bunch of niggas rappin
But one Chavis, bitch (clears throat)

[Hook]



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The germination of the womb
The creation of life
Rising up from the roots of fascination
With the truth
It's hard to find these days
It's hard to know what to believe
I contemplate of what I knew
Some shit I, couldn't be sure of
I let it out through this forum
From the mind of a foreign
Man where the flightless birds call
Seeing glory, seeing war
Thought I might have seen it all
But there's more
The money don't grow like trees grow
Funny how I see it clearer through the smoke
Nothing left but what I hope
The smile on my daughter, I watch it grow
Through this journey that I walk
I vow to stay involved
Make the cross over from watching over the fence
To jumping into this tournament
Gettin' up off the bench
Remember, when all they had was the criticism
I guess my indecision
Made it hard to see my vision
They don't understand us
They don't understand the fact we didn't plan this
What happens to us rappers when the tasks fade
And the liquor catches up with us
And the women that we hurt
Come back to fuck it up for us

[Outro]
But what if
You could change
The fabric of time, fabric of time
Change the, fabric of time
Like the butterfly effect



Love of God, it won't let me touch you
Devil's grip, it won't let me breathe
Fool's gold is love over money
This time I've lost my control

Love of God, it won't let me near you
Devil's grip, is all over me
Perfect is less than perfection
This time I don't want to see what's left of me

Love of God, you won't disappoint me
Fail to feel I don't want to feel
Leave me, I'm broken and hungry
This time I don't want to feel what's left to feel

Here and forever I have found
Life with no answers you have found
Here in the anti I have gone
Skin black from bruising



You make me dirty, make me feel like a whore
Right here where you want me, down with the fleas in the floor

Still you tried to clean me, bleach away like stains
Blackened ash in your mouth won't distil your distain

It doesn't matter when you say, I'm not clean anymore
It doesn't matter when you say, I'm dirty like a whore

Here is nothing
For you there is nothing pure



Hope
You let me down
Again
Turn to stone loose ground
Cry
When you feel no more
Trust
You've been longing for

You let me down
Once again
You let me down
Once again
Again

It's a crime
That you blame me for
When we lie
Are they closing doors?
Are you slowly giving up?
Are you you slowly giving up?

Everybody runs
Hope
You let me down
Again
Turn to stone loose ground
Cry
When you feel no more
Trust
You've been longing for

You let me down
Once again
Everybody runs

It's a crime
That you blame me for
When we lie
Are they closing doors?
Are you slowly giving up?
Are you slowly giving up?

Everybody runs
