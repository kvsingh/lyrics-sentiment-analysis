[Verse 1]
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking
But then again sometimes I get really sweet
So what does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
You're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so...
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
You're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need

[Bridge]
I think of you
I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you
I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you
I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you
I want you too
I'd fall for you

[Outro]
It's affection, always
It's affection, always



[Verse 1]
I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 2]
And on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me
And no one else...

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 3]
And I'm kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me I don't want you to leav

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle



[Verse 1]
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Verse 2]
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Bridge]
When we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side



[Verse 1]
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

[Chorus]
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You’ve been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

[Chorus]
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

[Bridge]
Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees
Oh please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

[Verse 3]
Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

[Chorus]
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

[Outro]
Oh
When you're all alone
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
I will be there too



[Verse 1]
Each time you fall in love
It’s clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn’t safe
And  each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it’s worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn’t real

[Chorus]
She took you for a ride in summer baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in

[Verse 2]
Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It’s clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn’t safe

[Chorus}
She took you for a ride in summer baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in



You should have seen by the look in my eyes
That there was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice
But you didn't listen
You play dead, but you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up and hissing

And I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
Because it was us baby way before them
And we're still together
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

And I meant every word that I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you



Seen you from afar
Wondered who you are
Wondered what you're like
Think you're just my type

And now I'm dreaming of you

Want you, yes I do
Bet you never knew it
Think you'd suit me fine
Want you all the time

And now I'm dreaming of you

You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it



Baby I'm a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture
And there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of rollercoaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies

And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips

Waterfalls I'm jumping down

I know you're leaving baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die



Starry eyes
How can I get to you my true little
Starry eyes
What can I say or do for you my little
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

Starry eyes
What can I say to make you listen
Starry eyes
What can I do for your attention
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

When I'm alone I hear & feel you
Wish that I could reach right out & touch you
But knowing you're the one to greet me & meet me
Two alone in the dark may it be

Starry eyes
The sparks will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen that I'm here being
For you starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine



[Verse 1]
Sun sets, we wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
See you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

[Chorus]
And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in the rear view

[Verse 2]
Sun sets, I want to hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

[Chorus]
And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
