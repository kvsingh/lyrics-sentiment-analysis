I used to think, darlin', you never did nothin'
But you were always up to somethin'
Always had a run in, yeah
I got to think those days are comin' to get ya
Now no body want to protect yah
They only want to forget yah
You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love
Dance all night cause people, they don't wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They don't wanna be an only - one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from
You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love
Little black submarines, operator please
Put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back, operator please
This is wreckin' my mind
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Pick you up, let you down when I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans, but they just disappeared
To the back of my mind
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Treasure maps, fallen trees, operator please
Call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease, operator please
Pass me back to my mind
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can’t take much more
I could never drown in
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high
Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can’t go without
I could never drown in
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high
Well I'm so above you, it is plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I don't mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting, waiting, waiting
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting
I'm a lonely boy
Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you
And I should have done you just the same
But I came to love you
Am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waiting, waiting, waiting
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting
I'm a lonely boy
Fever, where'd you run to?
Fever, where'd you run to?
Acting right is so routine
Fever let me live a dream
Fever I'm a slave to
No one misbehave too
Fever that misunderstood
Wouldn't leave you if I could
Fever
Fever cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever, can you hear me?
Fever, can you hear me?
You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to live again
It used to be a blessing
But fever's got me stressing
Realize I am to blame
But fever let me play the game
Fever
Fever cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Now if the cold, pale, light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Now if the cold, pale, light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Fever
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true
Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight
When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
It's such a shame
I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
I'm tellin' you to be ready
My dear
When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like 10 different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us not in love again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything
If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us not in love again
The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
She's alright, but you're all wrong
I could take the pitchfork from the Devil
Keep a super-suit like I'm Incredible
From the deep blue sea to the dark blue sky
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll grab a crocodile by its tail
Handcuff the judge and throw the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman breakdown and cry
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive
Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good
Say my name three times and you knock on wood
Candy man hooks, I terrorize your hood
Flashing Mac's on a cop the way a gangsta should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath then I walk through fire
Bear-hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty
Take the Sergeant's hat from his head and use it as a frisbee
Spit in the crocodile face
Have a ménage à trois with two female apes
Then sleep in the barrel of butcher knives
I drank honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked!
Roller blade across the Golden Gate, butt naked!
With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
When the Grim Reaper come, I'll look him right in his eye
I'll bust in the face of the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, 
I'm the man who stole the golden fleece
And I date-raped beauty right in front of the beast
The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive
