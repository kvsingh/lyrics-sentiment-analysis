Hear the sound of music drifting in the aisles
Elevator prozac stretching on for miles
The music of the future will not entertain
It's only meant to repress and neutralise your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no-one cares
No-one cares enough

Now the sound of music comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you, building cheaper thrills
The music of rebellion makes you wanna rage
But it's made by millionaires who are nearly twice your age

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no-one cares
No-one cares enough



Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river rushing through your ears

Arriving somewhere, but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?

Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs simplified
And all of my plans compromised
All of my dreams sacrificed

{Guitar solo}

Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong?

Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs simplified
And all of my plans compromised
All of my dreams --

{Guitar solo}

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?



As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head breaks the analog
And says:

"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said:

"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

"My David, don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"

Ghosts of the twenties rising
Golden summers just holding you

"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us, Lazarus
It's time for you to go"



Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blind to let it inside
The bed is unmade, some music still plays

TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker of the screen, a movie actress screams
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing

X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch, my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs, the prescription drugs
So you'll never find a person inside

My face is mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires, the pills are on the rise

[Chorus]
How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame, the action is tame
Explicitly dull, Arousal annuled

Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclaims all misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band - they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black, the music is crap

In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up a day

[Chorus]
How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with boredom

You don't try to be liked
You don't mind, you feel no sun
You steal a gun to kill time

You're somewhere, you're nowhere
You don't care, you catch the breeze
You still the leaves, so now where?



A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please

And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And I'm zoning out
I'm watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored
But I can't switch off

[Hook]
Only apathy
From the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores
Like zombies
Well what is the point?
What can money buy?
My hands on a gun and I find the range
God tempt me
Well what did you say?
Think I'm passing out

[Hook]

Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
I smiled into the sun

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen
There's black across the sun



Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A sixty ton angel falls to the earth
Pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides, I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here you're tying me up
I'm dying of love, it's OK



Always in my thoughts you are
Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape
I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are

Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul you are

The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again

Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel

The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again

The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again



I was born in '67
The year of Sgt. Pepper
And Are You Experienced

Into a suburban heaven
Yeah it should've been forever
It all seems to make so much sense

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies

She said luck is what you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now let's dance a while

She said nothing ever happens
If you don't make it happen
And if you can't laugh and smile

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies

And laughing in the summer showers
That's still the way I see you now

How does time break down
With no marker, things slow down
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged

I could tell you what I'm thinking
While we sit here drinking
But I'm not sure where to start

You see there's something wrong here
I'm sorry if I'm not clear
Can you stop smoking your cigar

But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies

And the coat you wore to Alton Towers
Is still the way I see you now



Nothing like this
Felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm
Lost in her arms
I keep a photograph
Give me a glimpse
Let me come in
Be there inside her
Here it begins
Here is the sin
Something to lie about

You think you're smart
I think you're art
We agree on this
It doesn't work
Feeling like dirt
Feeling like you don't care
We get a room
And in the gloom
She lights a cigarette
Clothes on the bed
Love me she said
I gave myself to her

I'm getting feelings I'm hiding too well
(Buried a heart-shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car

OK what's next?
After the sex
What do we do now?
Finding the time
Drawing the line
And never crossing it
Gave her the hours
Gave her the power
Cannot erase her
Gave her the truth
Gave her the proof
I gave her everything

I'm getting feelings I'm hiding too well
(Buried a heart-shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
On a drive out to the farm
Hair blown in an open car

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down your arm
Hair blown in an open car



And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifled through the cling and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In a dentist chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
When your world of bore
Forces through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high-heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Tempering lullaby
Like a fractured tie
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes I'd have to say I like my privacy
Did you know you're on closed-circuit TV ?
So smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mom and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the boys aren't there
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Deadwing lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A specter from the next life breathes his bargain of pain
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for her name

And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through
